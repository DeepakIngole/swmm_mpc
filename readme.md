# swmm_mpc 
`swmm_mpc` is a python package that can be used to perform model predictive control (MPC) for EPASWMM5 ([Environmental Protection Agency Stormwater Management Model](https://www.epa.gov/water-research/storm-water-management-model-swmm)). `swmm_mpc` relies on the [pyswmm package](https://github.com/OpenWaterAnalytics/pyswmm) which enables the step by step running of SWMM5 models through Python.
